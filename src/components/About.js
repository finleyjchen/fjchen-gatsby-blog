        <p>I made my first website at 11 years old – it was a WordPress website for a video game team. Since then, I’ve been using my knowledge in WordPress, PHP, and of course HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to help other businesses harness the potential of WordPress. I grew up in San Diego but now live in San Luis Obispo, California for school at Cal Poly.</p>
        <h3>Improving Daily</h3>
        <p>
            There’s no question the developer world is a fast-paced, growing one. There are new frameworks, trends, and technologies that developers have to constantly be learning and getting familiar with.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am great at reaching solutions to problems because of my ability to learn new things fast – Google, Stack Overflow, and software documentation are some of the resources I’m constantly using and reading every day.

            In preparation for the upcoming release of Gutenberg, I have been learning React and Redux.

<h3>Extra</h3>
<p>
In my spare time I like to play video games, eat ramen, write about nearly anything, spend time with my girlfriend, and study.

If it means anything, I pride myself in the Challenger rank (top 200 in North America) I achieved in the ever-popular video game League of Legends. I’m actually working on a website to provide statistics and helpful guides for the game character I play – Gangplank.
