As a web developer and a student, being enrolled in a university brings all kinds of student benefits, one of them being a [huge discount](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/plans.html) on the Adobe Creative Cloud, which includes all of the Adobe apps as well as Typekit, now called Adobe Fonts.  Typekit gives you access to the entire Adobe Font library.

(By the way, if you are a student, I highly recommend the [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)).

On to my favorite Typekit fonts.
